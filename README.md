## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Evidence

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description
The mount is similar to the base, but 2/3 in size. it:Is a 120mm x120mm rectangle, centered on the origin.
Has 4 symmetric holes in the corners, 10mm in diameter, 20mm from each side (and therefore, 80mm from each other)
Has another 25 mm circle in the center of the square.

this one was a bit more tricky. canvas had the wrong planes, but i could have figured it out myself :/ sorry for wasting your time :^) otherwise easy peasy

## AxleCollarBearings
Actually three assignments: the axle and collar, which is for connecting the wheels, and two bearings, which let the axel spin.
### Description
  the method of getting the wheel to spin
